<h1>Dinning Philosopher problem</h1>
<hr>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div>It is a classic synchronization problem in the context of Operating Systems and concurrent programming.</div><br>
<div>It illustrates the challenge of resource sharing and deadlock prevention by giving rights to eat to only those who have the left and right fork, which are free.</div>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<div>The Java program gives a visual representation of the Dinning Philosopher
Problem. In this problem, n number of philosophers are sitting at the round table.
Each Philosopher can either eat, think, or get hungry. By default, all philosophers
are thinking. If the philosopher wants to eat, then both left and right forks are
checked; if both are free, then onlythe  philosopher can eat; otherwise, they will be
hungry. </div>
